# Data model and JSON outputs

## Data locations
- Source outputs: `backend/output/`
- Frontend inputs: `frontend/public/data/`

The frontend expects these JSON files to exist in `frontend/public/data/` and uses them by name.

## fleet_weekly_stats.json
Produced by `aggregate_fleet_statistics()` in `backend/pipeline/process_trips.py`.

Key fields used in the UI:
- `total_trips`
- `by_load_category.LIGHT|MEDIUM|HEAVY.{count,percentage,avg_fuel_per_km}`
- `fleet_savings.{weekly_fuel_waste,weekly_cost_waste,annual_cost_waste,annual_fuel_waste,trips_with_waste,avg_waste_per_trip}`
- `sbs_fleet_projection.{projected_annual_cost_waste,projected_annual_fuel_waste}`

## scenario_light_load.json / scenario_heavy_optimal.json / scenario_heavy_wasteful.json
Each scenario is a full per-trip analysis output from `process_single_trip()`.

Key fields used in the UI:
- `trip_id`
- `load.{dominant_load_category,max_passenger_count,segments[]}`
- `fuel.{avg_fuel_per_km,total_fuel_liters,optimal_fuel_liters,waste_percentage,segments[]}`
- `savings.{priority,total_wasted_fuel,total_wasted_cost,waste_percentage,main_issue,main_action,heavy_aggressive_segments,heavy_aggressive_waste}`

## all_trips_processed.json
Full list of per-trip analysis objects. This is not currently displayed in the UI, but useful for future analysis and debugging.

## route_12_trips.json
Raw simulated trip data generated by `data_simulator.py`. This file is only used by the pipeline.

## data_summary.json
Optional summary stats from the simulator (not currently used by the UI).
